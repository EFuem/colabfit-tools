Getting started
===============

Installation
============

Currently, installation is only supported using :code:`pip` to install directly
from the private GitHub repository.

Using pip
^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install git+https://<username_or_pat>@github.com/colabfit/colabfit-tools.git

Note that since :code:`colabfit-tools` is currently still a private project,
:code:`<username_or_pat>` must either be your GitHub username (if you have access to the repository) or a
Personal Access Token that has appropriate permissions.

First steps
===========

* Take a look at the :ref:`Overview` to see how Datasets are structured.
* Review the :ref:`Basics of Configurations` to better understand how data is
  stored when it is first loaded in.
* Follow the :ref:`Basic example`
* Continue with the :ref:`QM9 example` and/or the :ref:`Si PRX GAP` example
