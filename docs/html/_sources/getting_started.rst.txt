Getting started
===============

Installation
------------

Currently, installation is only supported using :code:`pip` to install directly
from the private GitHub repository.

Using pip
^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install git+https://<username_or_pat>@github.com/colabfit/colabfit-tools.git

Note that since :code:`colabfit-tools` is currently still a private project,
:code:`<username_or_pat>` must either be your GitHub username (if you have access) or a
Personal Access Token that has appropriate permissions.
