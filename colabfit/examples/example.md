A single-line name to use for the dataset. All of the sections shown below are required (though they may be in a different order), and must have the exact names as used here. Additional sections may be added, but will be ignored when building the dataset.

# Authors

Authors of the dataset (one per line)

# Links

Links to associate with the dataset (one per line)

# Description

A multi-line human-readable description of the dataset

# Summary

A table providing a basic summary of the dataset. This table is not used for constructing the dataset, and will be programmatically generated by `Dataset.to_markdown()`.

# Data

A table for storing the inputs to `load_data()`. First column of each row
('Elements', 'File', 'Format', 'Name field') must be as spelled/capitalized
here. File name must Must have the following rows
(with first columns spelled/capitalized in
this way):

|||
|---|---|
|Elements| a comma-separated list of elements ("Mo, Ni, Cu")|
|File| a hyperlink to the raw data file ([example.extxyz](example.extxyz))|
|Format| a string specifying the file format ('xyz', 'cfg')|
|Name field| the key to use as the name of configurations ('name')|

# Properties

The tabular form of `Dataset.property_map`. For example:

|Name|Field|Units|
|---|---|---|
|energy|energy|eV|
|forces|F|eV/Ang|

# Property settings

The tabular form of `Dataset.ps_regexes`. For example:

|Regex|Method|Description|Labels|Files|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `.*` | VASP | energies/forces/stresses | PBE, GGA |  |

# Configuration sets

The tabular form of `Dataset.cs_regexes`. Only the first two columns ("Regex" and "Description") are required. The rest will be filled in programmatically by `Dataset.to_markdown()`. For example:

|Regex|Description|# of structures| # of atoms|
|---|---|---|---|
| `default` | The default CS to use for configurations | | |
| `H2O` | AIMD snapshots of liquid water at 100K | | |

# Configuration labels

The tabular form of `Dataset.co_label_regexes`. Only the first two columns ("Regex" and "Labels") are required. The rest will be filled in programmatically by `Dataset.to_markdown()`. For example:

|Regex|Labels|Counts|
|---|---|---|
| `H2O` | water, molecule |  |
| `.*` | 100K |  |
